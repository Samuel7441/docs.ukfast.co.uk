Users are still able to change their own passwords once logged in as normal. For more information on this, please visit the FastDesk documentation center at: https://docs.ukfast.co.uk/desktop/fastdesk/howtoguide/changepassword.html  
UKFast strongly advises that users have passwords that are 8-12 characters long and contains at least 3 of the following: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, symbols and special characters e.g “!” £”. 
Please note that passwords are set to expire after 42 days by default. It is acceptable for passwords to never expire if they meet the requirements set out in the policy. Subsequently, UKFast recommends that users should request for their password to never expire once they are happy that they have a strong password. This can be done by raising a ticket via the MyUKFast customer portal or by emailing support@ukfast.co.uk. Two-Factor Authentication is also available as an extra security control.
The policy and recommendations are in line with the guidance given by The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC). 



# FastDesk Password Policy

To keep up to date with best practice authentication and password management policies, the FastDesk user password policy will adhere to the following conditions:

- First time or temporarily reset passwords will be a randomly generated password that is 12 characters long and will contain a mixture of alphabetic and numeric characters. The user will then be required to change the password upon first logon.
- Passwords must be a minimum of 8 characters in length.
- Passwords must contain at least 3 of the following: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, symbols and special characters e.g “!” £”.
- Passwords must not contain the name of the user or account.

Failure to meet this policy will see passwords fail to change or reset.

The image above identifies the four front-end aspects that can be custom branded when a user reaches the login page.

1. The domain name of the webpage that users access in order to login can be custom branded. Instead of logging in via the `"www.fastdesk.co.uk"` webpage, clients can use their own domain name. This domain can be anything of your choosing and it often relates to the company using the FastDesk environment. The most common domains used are `"desktop.companyname.co.uk"` or `"vdi.companyname.co.uk"`.
* Once the domain has been purchased, you will also need to buy an SSL for your new domain to ensure that that your FastDesk environment is secure. You can purchase SSLs from UKFast within your [MyUKFast Control Panel](https://my.ukfast.co.uk/login). Once logged in, you can use the navigation menu to find SSL certificates. From here, you can buy a certificate. The FastDesk team will require the SSL in a `.pfx` format alongside the password (This can be put in a ticket to us). This will then be implemented.
* Next, you need to configure the DNS for the domain. You can do this from your DNS zone which is where you purchased the domain. We will provide you with the IP Address to point the domain too. You will need to create an A record for this.

.. note::

  You can purchase the domain from any reputable domain seller. However, please note that you will need access to control the DNS zone for the domain.

2. The background on the on login page can be custom branded. This can be changed to any background image you would like. UKFast require the dimension of the image that will be provided by the client to be `1920px x 1080px`.

3. The logo displayed on the login page can be custom branded. This can be changed to any logo you would like. UKFast require the dimension of the image that will be provided by the client to be `340px x 80px`.

4. The text and phone number displayed on the login page can also be custom branded. You may change this to a number which directly goes the person/team that would act as a first point of contact. To do this, we would simply require what you would like this text to be.

The image below identifies the three front-end aspects that can be custom branded once a user has logged in and reaches the Storefront.

5. The logo displayed on the Storefront can be custom branded. This can be changed to any logo you would like. Most clients make sure this logo matches the one on the login page. UKFast require image dimensions to be `340px x 80px`.

Please note that passwords are set to expire after 42 days by default. It is acceptable for passwords to never expire if they meet the requirements set out in the policy.
